### Please do not take this personally. It was made as a hobby project as an opportunity to learn the basics of React, Django REST framework and Canvas.

# Project Description
This is a 'yomama' meme generator which lets you enter a friend's name and the app will create a meme for you. You can then click a button, which will copy the meme image into your clipboard and you can then paste it to your friend. 

# Technology Used
For the API, Django REST framework was used. Canvas was used to dynamically create the images and React took care of everything in the frontend. For Styling, I used Bootstrap and pure CSS.
